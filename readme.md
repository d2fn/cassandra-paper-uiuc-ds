Cassandra: Principles and Application
--------------------------------
This repository includes the LaTeX source for a paper written as part of my Computer Science graduate work at UIUC

Abstract
--------------------------------
Cassandra is a distributed database designed to be highly scalable both in terms of storage volume and request throughput while not being subject to any single point of failure. This paper presents an architectural overview of Cassandra and discusses how its design is founded in fundamental principles of distributed systems. Merits of this design and practical use are given throughout this discussion. Additionally, a project is supplied demonstrating how Cassandra can be leveraged to store and query high-volume, consumer-oriented airline flight data.
